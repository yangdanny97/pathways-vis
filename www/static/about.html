        <h1>About Pathway</h1>
        <p>
            Pathway is a project developed by
            <a href="https://cornelldata.science">Cornell Data Science</a>
            in collaboration with the 
            <a href="https://learning.cis.cornell.edu">Future of Learning Lab</a>
            in order to help students explore their interests and find related
            classes and majors.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Pathway uses the official course enrollment records kept by Cornell
            to build relationships, make recommendations, and generate graphs
            among classes. Pathway <strong>does not</strong> use data related to
            class times, availability, or prerequisite structure, and as such
            should not be considered a final planning tool. Recommendations from
            Pathway are suggestions that are intended to inspire and aid
            exploration, but always check that classes are available to you
            using the <a href="https://classes.cornell.edu/">Course Roster</a>
            before enrolling.

        <h2>Pathway As A Research Project</h2>
        <h3>Your Contribution</h3>
        <p>
            By using Pathway, you are volunteering for research. We record
            de-identified information about your interactions with Pathway. Your
            usage is tracked through a unique hashed ID that is assigned when
            you log in using your NetID credentials. We may also ask you to
            answer some simple survey questions. In our ongoing effort to
            improve the accuracy and usefulness of the service, you may be
            exposed to some variation in the presentation of information
            available to you on Pathway. You may stop participating in this
            research at any time by no longer using Pathway. Neither your
            academic progress nor program eligibility is contingent on your
            participation or non-participation in Pathway. We study the data we
            gather through Pathway by analyzing trends and patterns in search
            and interaction. We also examine how search patterns on Pathway are
            related to course and major choice by connecting Pathway records to
            official registrar records. Because the data we collect is
            de-identified, we cannot and will not identify you by name in any
            discussions or publications, nor describe data in such a way that
            you could be identified.
        </p>

        <h3>Our Commitment</h3>
        <p>
            We use the data we gather to continually improve Pathway and
            contribute to an ongoing discussion of educational improvement at
            Cornell and other institutions. In the process of improving your
            user experience, we explore and analyze aggregated user data.
