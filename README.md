# pathways-vis
visualization project of pathways through cornell CIS

## Journal:

### Week ending on 9/21:

#### Goals: 

- All: explore the old codebase
- All: get access to the dataset and begin investigation

#### Progress:

- All: held brainstorming meetings and presented several visualization ideas to
  prof kizilcec
- Danny: built data module that supports easy loading/querying of enrollment
  data, enabling faster EDA

### Week ending on 9/28

#### Goals: 

- continue exploratory analysis
- Eric: try to build required courses
- Danny: try to build graph of dependent courses
- Sam: explore class selections by major and other useful data sources
- set up Github repo

#### Progress:

- Danny: set up repo, created graph library for modeling dependent courses that
  supports dumping to graphviz DOT format, calculated some summary statistics on
  the graph
- Eric: used Sam's work to build a heuristic to get required courses (top 10 of # of students in class / # of students
  in major) and possible paths between them (75% of max path between 2 classes).
  Made simple viz in D3 to show results
- Built notebook with Eric to identify popular/core courses and demo an
  implementation of CoS API

### Week ending on 10/5

#### Goals: 

- Danny: tune thresholds for including classes in graph, separate graphs for
  different majors, (stretch) investigate undirected edges and dumping graph to
  JSON for displaying with D3.
- Sam: start working on ways to interpret data and make class recommendations
- Eric: update requirement graph with classes take same semester, try to get
  force graph to make a better vis that will look cleaner

#### Progress:
- Danny: support for JSON dumping and separate graphs for different majors.
  built co-enrollment graph. designed and built UI prototype with dummy data.
- Eric: read the papers, used Danny's method of getting class to class to build
  previous graphs and get classes next to each other, still need to improve viz
- Sam: built site prototype, started work on recommendations

### Week ending on 10/12

#### Goals: 
- Danny: refine UI prototype, more investigation for undirected edges and
  thresholding, investigate graph representation size
- Eric: improve viz for required classes, combine required classes that are
  semester to semester and same semester together to improve graph
- Sam: build a preliminary recommendation prototype, incorporate some
  interactivity into site

#### Progress:
- Eric: made required classes with co and next semester
- Danny: calculated graph JSON sizes, added animations to UI and began
  integrating real data

### Week ending on 10/19

#### Goals: 
- Eric: help with backend, develop core_courses endpoint
- Danny: integrate real data into interactive schedule UI, connect to Sam's
  website UI
- Sam: Start building out site prototype with bootstrap and npm

### Progress:
- Danny: integrated CS course data with UI for demo, with really simple
  recommendation metric
- Eric: building json of required courses
- Sam: Built interactive site model using search API and bootstrap

### Week ending on 10/26

#### Goals:
- All: build off of current prototypes for a minimum viable product, aiming for
  completion on approx 11/1
- Eric: build major courses in golang
- Danny: start working on GoLang server, figure out how to integrate that with
  UI; additionally, build out a static version which uses all 3 datasets
- Sam: Improve and streamline UX around interaction modes, aim to improve major
  selection experience

#### Progress:
- Demoed @ Kizilcec lab meeting, got feedback on priorities for next week
- Integrated frontend with server, integrated codebase for search/landing page with interactive tiles

### Week ending 11/2

#### Goals:
1. UI on the RHS: add timeline indicator and clear design for what is a
   selection vs. recommendation
2. implement adding/removing of courses to appear on RHS
3. ensure some degree of serendipity for finding out of major courses in
   uncommon departments, i.. donâ€™t overemphasize common courses
4. netid login
5. user interaction logging using netid as the identifier

#### Progress:
1. Several UI improvements are made
   - Eric: updated algo for core courses, tried adding semester text and added
     right click context menu
   - Sam: Navbar added
   - Sam: Implemented major selection dropdown
2. Done - Danny
3. No progress
4. Server is deployed on pathway.cis.cornell.edu with NetID login enabled - Danny
5. NetID + add/delete/search is logged to Google Stackdriver - Danny

- Sam: Integrated server endpoints for popular and recommended classes

### Week ending 11/9

#### Goals:
- improving the interface, reducing errors and unexpected behaviors
- add hashing for logging netIDs (Quick fix)
- refine algorithm to promote less common courses
- investigate new/improved vis
- improve search behavior
- Sam:
  - add popovers for class info
  - make class links open in new tab
  - Add about page
  - Make the splash page look more like Bing
  - Add explanatory text to splash page
  - Improve display of major code

#### Meeting With Professor 11/4/19
- Improve splash page 
  - put pathways logo at top and make it an actual logo
  - change drop down to text entry for when we get more majors
  - Add explanatory text
  - potentially scrape all HREF from the cornell fields of study website
  - Add "pathway is a research project, click here to learn more about it" aka about page
- Improve vis page
  - Figure out intuitive design for viz that's independent of left side
  - Figure out how to represent time (arrow)
  - When clicking on viz nodes, add exploratory card to the left side
  - Add popovers for class info

### Meeting 8 November
- Sample schedule button
  - Build a pre-filled schedule for a whole career
- Show suggestions from each course or for all courses?
- Create 1d list of courses by randomizing order of courses in each semester
  - Eliminates co- vs. post- take
  - Get a normalized positional score to place nodes in a graph
  - Get relational positions before aggregating
  - Use relations to add nodes into graph
- Enable serendipity
- Use Cases
  - Freshman: Choosing a major
  - Junior: CS major choosing courses
  - Senior: Looking for fun/interesting courses
- User interviews

#### Progress:
- hashing for NetIDs - Danny
- modify server endpoint to return directed edges - Danny
- make new mockup of "selected semester" system - Danny
- updated to force graph viz - Eric
- added directed edges to viz - Eric

### Week ending 11/16

#### Goals
- get "average semester" data
- prefilled schedule button
- display edges between nodes, label each row, add large arrow to show time
- merge semester-select and FD layout branches to main branch
- build out unordered reccommendation flow
- modes for "graph/unordered", "relevance/random" courses

#### Progress
- prefilled schedule button
- edges between courses + semester select workflow merged with main branch
- hover tooltips
- quick-fill schedule using dropdown menu

#### Midterm Presentations Feedback 11/15
- hoverover -> change circle text to "Remove" (done)
- reorder nodes to reduce edge overlap
- transparency over "how" for recs, give users more control over results (bias diversity vs relevance)

### TODO - tasks backlog
- Optimize frontend compilation performance, reduce dependencies
- Optimize webpack CSS loading (right now CSS loads after JS, which loads after the body, resulting in no styling for 1/2 sec after page load)
- ~Brainstorm and implement intuitive user flow for L-R pane interaction~
- Log using local DB instead of StackDriver
- Reach out to CourseCrafter for API access (maybe)
- optimization to response time - reduce graph size
- automatic data extraction script instead of using notebooks
